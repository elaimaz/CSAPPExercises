### ***Question***:
Your assignement will be to write a Y86 program to perform bubblesort. For reference, the following C function implements bubblesort using array referencing:  

```
/* Bubble sort: Array version */
void bubble_s(int *data, int count) {
    int i, last;
    for (last = count - 1; last > 0; last--) {
        for (i = 0; i < last; i++) {
            if (data[i+1] < data[i]) {
                /* Swap adjacent elements */
                int t = data[i+1];
                data[i+1] = data[i];
                data[i] = t;
            }
        }
    }
}
```  

1. Write and test a C version that references the array elements with pointers, rather than using array indexing.
2. Write and test a Y86 program consisting of the function and test code. You may find it useful to pattern your implementation after IA32 code generated by compiling your C code. Although pointer comparisions are normally done using unsigned arithmetic, you can use signed arithmetic for this exercise.

### ***Answear***:  

1. [main.c](./main.c).
2. [bubble_sort_pointer.yo](./bubble_sort_pointer.yo)

### ***Notes:***:

I could not run correctly exercise 2 on the simulator. it does not show errors, but the program crashes after one specific mrmoq instruction on the l3 label.
