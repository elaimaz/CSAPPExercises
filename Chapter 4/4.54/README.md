### ***Expected time***: ***2h*** :hourglass_flowing_sand:

### ***Question***:
The Ô¨Åle pipe-nt.hcl contains a copy of the HCL code for PIPE, plus a declaration of the constant J_YES with value 0, the function code for an unconditional jump instruction. Modify the branch prediction logic so that it predicts conditional jumps as being not-taken while continuing to predict unconditional jumps and call as being taken. You will need to devise a way to get valC, the jump target address, to pipeline register M to recover from mispredicted branches. See the lab material for directions on how to generate a simulator for your solution and how to test it.
