### ***Question***:

Consider numbers having a binary representation consisting of an infinite string of the form 0. y
y y y y y   , where y is a k-bit sequence. For example, the binary representation of 1/3 is
0.01010101    (y = 01), while the representation of 1/5 is 0.001100110011    (y = 0011).  

A. Let Y = B2U<sub>k</sub>(y), that is, the number having binary representation y. Give a formula
in terms of Y and k for the value represented by the infinite string.  
**Hint:** Consider the effect of shifting the binary point k positions to the right.

B. What is the numeric value of the string for the following values of y?  
    (a). 101  
    (b). 0110  
    (c). 010011
