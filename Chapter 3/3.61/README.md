### ***Question***:
The code generated by the C compiler for var_prod_ele (Figure 3.29) cannot fit all of the values it uses in the loop in registers, and so it must retrieve the value of n from memory on each iteration. Write C code for this function that incorporates optimizations similar to those performed by GCC, but such that the compiled code does not spill any loop values into memory.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall that the processor only has six registers available to hold temporary data, since registers %ebp and %esp cannot be used for this purpose. One of these registers must be used to hold the result of the multiply instruction. Hence, you must reduce the number of values in the loop from six (result, Arow, Bcol, j, n, and 4*n) to five.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will need to find a strategy that works for yout particular compiler. Keep trying different strategies until you find one that works.
