### ***Question***:
inte-compatible processors also support an "extended precision" floating point format with an
80-bit word divided into a sign bit, k = 15 exponent bits, a single integer bit, and n = 63
fraction bits. The integer bit is an explicit copy of the implied bit in the IEEE floating point
representation. That is, it equals 1 for normlized values and 0 for denormalized values. Fill
in the following table giving the approximate values of some "interesting" number in this format:

| Description                    |  Value   |  Decimal  |
|--------------------------------|:--------:| :------:  |
| Smallest positive denormalized |          |           |
| Smallest positive normalized   |          |           |
| Largest normalized             |          |           |
