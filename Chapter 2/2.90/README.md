### ***Question***:
Around 250 B.C., the Greek mathematician Archimedes proved that <sup>223</sup>&frasl;<sub>71</sub> < $\pi$ < <sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. Had he had access to a computer and the standard library <math.h>, he would have been able to determine that the single-precision floating-point approximation of $\pi$ has the hexadecimal representation 0x40490FDB. Of course, all of these are just approximations, since $\pi$ is not rational.  

1. What is the fractional binary number denoted by this floating-point value? 
    - 0 10000000 10010010000111111011011

2. What is the fractional binary representation of <sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>? **Hint:** See [Problem 2.82.](../2.82/README.md)  
    - 0 10000000 10000000000000000000000

3. At what bit position (relative to the binary point) do these two approximations to $\pi$ diverge?
    - 12
