### ***Question***:
Following the bit level floating point coding rules, implement the function with the following prototype:  

```
/* Compute (float) i */
float_bits float_i2f(int i);
```  

For argument i, this function computes the bit-level representation of (float) i.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Test your function by evaluating it for all 2<sup>32</sup> values of argument f and comparing the result to what would be obtained using your machine's floating-point operations.
