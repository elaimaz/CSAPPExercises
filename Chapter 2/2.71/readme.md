### ***Question***:

You just started working for a company that is implementing a set of procedures to operate on a
data structure where 4 signed bytes are packed into a 32-bit unsigned. Bytes within the word are
numbered from 0 (least significant) to 3 (most significant). You have been assigned the task of
implementing a function for a machine using two's-complement arithmetic and arithmetic right shifts
with the following prototype:

```
/* Declaration of data type where 4 bytes are packed into an unsigned */
typedef unsigned packed_t

/* Extract byte from word. Return as signed integer */
int xbyte(packed_t word, int bytenum);
```

That is, the function will extract the designed byte and sign extend it to be a 32-bit int.  
&emsp;Your predeccessor (who was fired for incompetence) wrote the following code:

```
/* Failed attempt at xbyte */
int xbyte(packed_t word, int bytenum)
{
    return (word >> (bytenum << 3)) & 0xFF;
}
```


1. What is wrong with this code?  
R: This function can’t extract negative number from packet_t word.  


2. Give a correct implementation of the function that uses only left and right shifts, along with
one subtraction.
