* Assumptions
	* Integers are represented in two's complement form.
	* Right shifts of signed data are performed arithmetically.
	* Data type int is w bits long. For some of the problems, you will be given a specific value for w, but otherwise your code should work as long as w is a multiple of 8. You can use expression sizeof(int)<<3 to compute w.
* Forbidden
	* Conditionals (if or ? :), loops, switch statements, function calls, and macro invocations.
	* Division, modulus and multiplication.
	* Relative comparision operations (<, >, <=, and >=).
	* Casting, either explicit or implicit.
* Allowed operations
	* All bit-level and logic operations.
	* Left and right shifts, but only with shift amounts between 0 and w - 1.
	* Addition and subtraction.
	* Equality (==) and inequality (!=) tests. (Some of the problems do not allow these).
	* Integer constants INT_MIN and INT_MAX.
