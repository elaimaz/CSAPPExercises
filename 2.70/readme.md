Exercise 2.70
==============

### ***Dificulty***: :star: :star: :star:

---

### ***Expected time***: ***2h***:hourglass_flowing_sand:

---

### ***Question***:

Write code for a function with the following prototype:

>Return 1 when x can be represented as an n-bit, 2's complement number; 0 otherwise.
	Assume 1 <= n <= w

```
int fits_bits(int x, int n);
```

Your function should follow the bit-level [integer coding rules](https://github.com/elaimaz/CSAPPExercises/blob/main/Utils/CH2Rules.txt).
