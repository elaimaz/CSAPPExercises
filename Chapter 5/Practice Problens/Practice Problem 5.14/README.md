### ***Practice Problem 5.14***:
The marketing department at your company has promised your customers that the next software release will show a 2x performance improvement. You have been assigned the task of delivering on that promise. You have determined that only 80% of the system can be improved. How much (i.e., what value of k) would you need to improve this part to meet the overall performance target?

### ***Answear***:  

$$ S = \frac{1}{(1 - \alpha) + \frac{\alpha}{k}} $$  

$$ 2 = \frac{1}{(1 - 0.8) + \frac{0.8}{k}} $$  

$$ 2 = \frac{1}{0.2 + \frac{0.8}{k}} $$  

$$ \frac{1}{2} = 0.2 + \frac{0.8}{k} $$  

$$ \frac{1}{2} - 0.2 = \frac{0.8}{k} $$  

$$ \frac{1 - 0.4}{2} = \frac{0.8}{k} $$  

$$ \frac{0.6}{2} = \frac{0.8}{k} $$  

$$ 0.6k = 1.6 $$  

$$ k = \frac{1.6}{0.6} $$  

$$ k = 2.666666667 $$
