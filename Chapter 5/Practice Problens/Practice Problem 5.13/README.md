### ***Practice Problem 5.13***:
Suppose you work as a truck driver, and you have been hired to carry a load of potatoes from Boise, Idaho, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, a total distance of 2500 kilometers. You estimate you can average 100 km/hr driving within the speed limits, requiring a total of 25 hours for the trip.  

1. You hear on the news that Montana has just abolished its speed limit, which constitutes 1500 km of the trip. Your truck can travel at 150 km/hr. What will be your speedup for the trip?  
2. You can buy a new turbocharger for your truck at www.fasttrucks.com. They stock a variety of models, but the faster you want to go, the more it will cost. How fast must you travel through Montana to get an overall speedup for your trip of 5/3?

### ***Answear***:  
1. 
$$
\begin{align*}
2500 \text{ km} &= 100\% \\
1500 \text{ km} &= \alpha 
\end{align*}
$$  

$$ \frac{150000 \text{km}}{2500\text{km}} = \alpha $$  

$$ \alpha = 60\% $$  

---  

$$ k = \frac{150 \text{km/h}}{100 \text{km/h}} $$  

$$ k = \frac{1}{5}\text{km/h} $$

$$ S = \frac{1}{(1 - 0.6) + \frac{0.6}{1.5}} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{0.4 + \frac{0.6}{1.5}} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{0.4 + 0.4} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{0.8} $$  

$$ S = 1.25 $$

2. 
$$ \frac{5}{3} = \frac{1}{(1 - 0.6) + \frac{0.6}{x}} $$  

$$ \frac{5}{3} = \frac{1}{0.4 + \frac{0.6}{x}} $$  

$$ \frac{3}{5} = 0.4 + \frac{0.6}{x} $$  

$$ \frac{3}{5} - 0.4 = \frac{0.6}{x} $$  

$$ \frac{3}{5} - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{0.6}{x} $$  

$$ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{0.6}{x} $$  

$$ x = 5 * 0.6 $$  

$$ x = 3 $$
