### ***Practice Problem 5.2***:
Later in this chapter, we will start with a single function and generate many different variants that preserve the functionâ€™s behavior, but with different performance characteristics. For three of these variants, we found that the run times (in clock cycles) can be approximated by the following functions:  

```
Version 1: 60 + 35n
Version 2: 136 + 4n
Version 3: 157 + 1.25n
```  
For what values of n would each version be the fastest of the three? Remember that n will always be an integer.

### ***Answear***: 
Version 1: n = 0
Version 2: n = 3
Version 3: n = 8
