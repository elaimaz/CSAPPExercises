### ***Question***:
Suppose you are given the task of improving the performance of a program consisting of three parts. Part A requires 20% of the overall run time, part B requires 30%, and part C requires 50%. You determine that for $1000 you could either speed up part B by a factor of 3.0 or part C by a factor of 1.5. Which choice would maximize performance?

### ***Answear***:   
For B:

$$ S = \frac{1}{(1 - \alpha) + \frac{\alpha}{k}} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{(1 - 0.3) + \frac{0.3}{3}} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{0.7 + \frac{0.3}{3}} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{0.7 + \frac{0.3}{3}} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{0.7 + 0.1} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{0.8} $$  

$$ S = 1.25 $$

For C:

$$ S = \frac{1}{(1 - \alpha) + \frac{\alpha}{k}} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{(1 - 0.5) + \frac{0.5}{1.5}} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{0.5 + \frac{0.5}{1.5}} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{0.5}{1.5}} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{\frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6}} $$  

$$ S = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{6}} $$  

$$ S = \frac{6}{5} $$  

$$ S = 1.2 $$
