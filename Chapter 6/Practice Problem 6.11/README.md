### ***Practice Problem 6.11***:  
In the previous dotprod example, what fraction of the total references to x and y will be hits once we have padded array x?  

---  

### ***Answear***:  

$$ \frac{8}{100} = \frac{6}{x} $$  

$$ 8x = 600 $$  

$$ x = \frac{600}{8} $$  

$$ x = \frac{600}{8} $$  

$$ x = 75 $$

75% of hit, 25% of miss.
